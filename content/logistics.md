## Where to access the readings

The readings are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vxc8QM-C4GGMakG_PcmYg2lbWtuFAMCh?usp=drive_link). If there are any changes to the syllabus, the Google Drive folder will be automatically updated. 

## Where to submit what 

Submit essays, reading responses, and final projects using the [class Canvas site](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/474927/). For reading responses, you've been assigned to random 2-person groups for each week. The (randomly selected) group leader should submit the response consisting of answers to the three questions listed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N3eQQd40xufCTC0irJMPP7barnsBlyDQFh5fp9LLJpM/edit?usp=sharing). Your response will be visible to the other class members. It's useful to take the time before class to read through the responses from the other groups.


## Use of AI for classwork 
Despite large language models being in the name of this course, please engage with the readings using your own brain. I recommend you minimize interruptions, cut yourself off from the Internet and grapple with the readings. Write down questions as you read. It's fine to look things up or chat with an LLM to help you understand things, but it is helpful to keep in mind that the work you are doing for the course is not for impressing me or getting a good grade. It is in the service of helping *you* do good science, to create useful knowledge.
